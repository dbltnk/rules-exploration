## TODO

* graphs/stats

## Ideas

* multiple layers 
** independent by default
** option: cells above/below effect individuals
** option: aggregate stats from one layer affect all individuals in another layer
* more states & stats per cell than just dead/alive
* moving creatures
* Themes
** cells in petri dish
** life on a foreign planet

## Refactoring

* remove unnecessary assets/code
* get rid of potential copyright issues
* make the ideas above easily possible for a novice coder like me
* UI should be visible in edit mode
* support drag & drop movement of tiles
* support zoom & drag-move of camera
* support animations, shaders, etc
