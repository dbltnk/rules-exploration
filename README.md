## TODO

## Ideas

* multiple layers 
** independent by default
** option: cells above/below effect individuals
** option: aggregate stats from one layer affect all individuals in another layer
* more states & stats per cell than just dead/alive
* moving creatures
* Themes
** cells in petri dish
** life on a foreign planet

## Refactoring

* make it start up super fast (became really slow with the addition of the charts)
* UI should be visible in edit mode

* use some reasonably stable unity version
* remove unnecessary assets/code (-> make shit open quickly, less importing)
* get rid of sample code (procgen toolkit, chart tool) & their potential copyright issues
* make the ideas above easily possible for a novice coder like me

* support drag & drop movement of tiles
* support zoom & drag-move of camera
* support animations, shaders, etc
